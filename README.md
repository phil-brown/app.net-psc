app.net-psc
===========

App.net Public Stream Client (PSC). Provides a bare-bones sample application for downloading and viewing App.net public stream data. 

This was originally a coding challenge for a job application, so some folders are still named "ChaiOne Challenge".
app.net-psc is far from fancy, but does provide some easy code for fetching the public stream data, parsing it (special thanks to 
[SBJson](https://github.com/stig/json-framework/)), and displaying it in a table view (with pull-to-refresh).
